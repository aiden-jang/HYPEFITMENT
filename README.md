## Background

Getting that perfect fitment you wanted on your car takes a lot of trial and error. Have you ever wished there was a tool that visually calculates and shows the rim and tire setups before you drop $$$ on them? HYPEFITMENT eliminates the hassle. You do not need to waste time googling or digging in forums on what kind of rims and tires will fit your car or truck.

## Functionality & MVPs

In HYPEFITMENT, users will be able to:

* Input their current or OE (Original Equipment) setups.
* Input their new setups.
* See how their new setups will look like.
* See the comparsion between their current and new setups.
* Lock and change the only specific specs and see the update.
* Gain information on how their new setups will affect their cars' overall performance compared to their current setups.
