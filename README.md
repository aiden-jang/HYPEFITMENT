# HYPEFITMENT

## Background

Getting that perfect fitment you wanted on your car takes a lot of trial and error. Have you ever wished there was a tool that visually calculates and shows the rim and tire setups before you drop $$$ on them? HYPEFITMENT eliminates the hassle. You do not need to waste time googling or digging in forums on what kind of rims and tires will fit your car or truck.

## Functionality & MVPs

In HYPEFITMENT, users will be able to:

* Input their current or OE (Original Equipment) setups.
* Input their new setups.
* See how their new setups will look like.
* See the comparsion between their current and new setups in a graph.
* Lock and change the certain specs and see the update.
* Gain information on how their new setups will affect their cars' overall performance compared to their current setups.

* Webpack
* Npm
* DOM API

## Implementation Timeline

* Tuesday - Implement a comparison feature. Apply the CSS.
* Wednesday - Fix last minute bugs.
* Thursday Morning - Deploy to GitHub pages. 

## Bonus features

If I have time left, I will use three.js to render the setups in 3D.
