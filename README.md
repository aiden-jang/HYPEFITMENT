Background
A 1-2 paragraph description of your project, providing the necessary context for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it does.

Functionality & MVPs
Fill in this template:

In { project name }, users will be able to:

{ 4-6 core features or functionalites of your project }
{ feature }
{ feature }
{ feature }
{ feature }
In addition, this project will include:

{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
{ other aspect of project }
{ other aspect of project }
Wireframes
Draw the layout of your project: the major sections of the game view, the chart and its legend, the game controls and about me links, etc. This doesn't have to be a fully detailed mockup; it can just be labeled boxes showing the layout of your project. See the Sample Proposal for an example.

Wireframe.cc is a great tool for quickly creating wireframes.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you might use a library like three.js. If you're doing data visualization, you might use d3 for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.
