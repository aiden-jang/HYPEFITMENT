# HYPEFITMENT

## Background

Getting that perfect fitment you wanted on your car takes a lot of trial and error. Have you ever wished there was a tool that visually calculates and shows the different rim and tire setups before you drop $$$ on them? HYPEFITMENT eliminates the hassle. You do not need to waste time googling or digging the forums what kind of rims and tires will fit your car or truck.

## Functionality & MVPs

In HYPEFITMENT, users will be able to:

* See the calculation of the attributes (tire width, profile, diameter, rim width, offset etc.) and check if their setups are valid.
* Grahpically see how their setups will look like.
* Compare old and new setups in both graph and chart.
* List possible alternative setups.
* See how their new setups will affect performance compared to their old setups.
