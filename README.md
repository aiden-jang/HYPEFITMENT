# HYPEFITMENT

## Background

Getting that perfect fitment you wanted on your car takes a lot of trial and error. Have you ever wished there was a tool that visually calculates and shows the rim and tire setups before you drop $$$ on them? HYPEFITMENT eliminates the hassle. You do not need to waste time googling or digging the forums what kind of rims and tires will fit your car or truck.

## Functionality & MVPs

In HYPEFITMENT, users will be able to:

* Enter their current or OE (Original Equipment) setups.
* Enter their new setups they would like.
* See the comparsion between current and new setups in both graph and chart.
* 



* See the calculation of the attributes (tire width, profile, diameter, rim width, offset etc.) and check if their setups are valid.
* 
* List possible alternative setups.
* See how their new setups will affect performance compared to their old setups.

Explain why you are using canvas and what you are using it for
Further breakdown each MVP and be specific with what exactly you are implementing in your timeline. Currently, it is far too vague
