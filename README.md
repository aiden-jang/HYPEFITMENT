# HYPEFITMENT

## Background

Getting that perfect fitment you wanted on your car takes a lot of trial and error. Have you ever wished there was a tool that visually calculates and shows the different wheel and tire setups before you drop $$$ on them? HYPEFITMENT eliminates the hassle. You do not need to waste time googling or digging the forums what kind of rims and tires setups will fit on your car or truck. It's all about the fitment.

## Functionality & MVPs

In HYPEFITMENT, users will be able to:

* See the calculation of the attributes.
* Visually see how their setups will look like.
* Compare old and new setups in both graph and chart.
* List possible alternative setups.
* See how their setup will affect performance.
